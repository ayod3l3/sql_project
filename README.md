# This is my SQL project - Secure Database Systems


This project aims to computerize a customer management and stock recording system, transitioning from a paper-based system to a digital database. The database captures customer details, transaction records, and product inventory, enabling efficient management of stock across multiple stores and facilitating the generation of comprehensive management reports. This solution ensures enhanced operational efficiency and improved customer service.
